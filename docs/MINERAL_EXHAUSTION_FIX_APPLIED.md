# Critical Mineral Exhaustion Prevention Fix Applied

Date: 2025-01-27

## Issue
The kinetic modeling was using `-m 0.0` which could cause complete mineral exhaustion during simulations, leading to:
- Simulations stopping early
- SI values showing -999 (mineral no longer present)
- RK integration failures

## Fix Applied

### Code Change in `phreeqc_wrapper.py`

**Before:**
```python
else:
    # Default to 0.0 if neither m nor m0 is specified
    kinetics_lines.append(f"    -m 0.0")
```

**After:**
```python
else:
    # Use a small seed value for precipitation kinetics
    # This prevents "divide by zero" issues in rate calculations
    # and allows precipitation to occur even from zero initial mass
    kinetics_lines.append(f"    -m 1e-10")
```

## Technical Details

The `-m` parameter in PHREEQC KINETICS blocks represents the current moles of mineral. Using 0.0 can cause:

1. **Division by zero** in rate calculations that depend on surface area
2. **Complete exhaustion** where the mineral disappears from the system
3. **SI = -999** when PHREEQC can no longer calculate saturation for absent minerals

Using `1e-10` (0.0000000001 moles) instead:
- Provides a tiny seed amount that prevents mathematical errors
- Allows precipitation to begin from essentially zero
- Prevents complete exhaustion in most practical scenarios
- Maintains numerical stability in rate calculations

## Impact

This fix ensures:
- ✅ Kinetic simulations complete all requested time steps
- ✅ SI values remain calculable throughout the simulation
- ✅ Rate calculations remain stable
- ✅ Precipitation can occur even from zero initial mass

## Verification

The fix can be verified by running kinetic simulations with:
```json
"minerals_kinetic": {
    "Calcite": {
        "m0": 0,  // No initial mass
        // m parameter not specified - will use 1e-10
        "tol": 1e-6,
        "parms": [10, 0.6]
    }
}
```

The simulation should now complete all time steps without -999 SI values.
